The new DPP ladnding page offers an opportunity for brands, with the possibility to harness this new touchpoint to connect with customers.
It also ensures transparency and a powerful sense of trust that can enpower brands and strengthen their reputation.

The information related to each Digital Product Passport will reside and will be consultable on its own web landing page.
The landing page will feature media of the product and information related to its on-chain status, on top of sections for the regulation mandated information split into categories.

If the owner (customer) has not linked their wallet to their profile or claimed the token for their product yet, they will also be able to do so with ease from this page, which will then transform in a touchpoint they can use to show off their wardrobe/collection.

title: A brand new customer experience

Customers of brands in the OTB group will have access to a brand new experience through the customer area of the website(s) and a custom mobile app. This app will allow them to interface with the new and innovative experience and engage in the community through the gamification features, the new certified and VIP second hand marketplaces and reap the benefits for their loyalty.

A first prototype of the app could present 5 major pages:

title: The homepage

The homepage will be the main point of contact between OTB and the customer. Based on the customer's level and their brand preferences, the news section will allow the brands to provide meaningful news and insights, in order to entice checking out a new collection, an upcoming event or create interest in new initiatives.
The promotion section will provide loyal customers with incentives to treat themselves with a new piece from their favorite brands.
On the homepage, users will also be able to see what tasks they are going to be able to perform in order to gain points, climb up the leaderboard and achieve new levels.
A final upcoming section will provide teasers for upcoming news, to grow the user's curiosity and make them eager to come back.

title: The profile page

On top of providing an interface to customize their profile details and avatar, the profile page will also allow users to link their AURA Blockchain wallet (or a create one, if they haven't used the system yet) and social media profiles (in order to participate in sharing tasks). It will also feature access to the OTB blockchain knowledge base, a place for less tech-savvy customers to better understand the technology behind the news experiences and benefits.

title: The collection page

the collection page will work as a digital counterpart to the customer's wardrobe, showcasing all of their OTB products. The user will alsob be able to make this collection public for others to see on the platform and the landing page of each Product Passport.

title: The leaderboard page

The leaderboard page is the heart of the action for our gamification strategy. Customers will be able to explore the available point gaining tasks and see what is their positioning compared to other members of the community. The leaderboard will display every user's avatar, which serves as an incentive in customizing it to show off the most eye catching pieces in one's collection.

title The marketplace page

The marketplace, or "pre-loved" page, will be the place where users can list or browse through a certified second hand market. The new DPP and NFT integration will ensure the authenticity and ownership of the products, empowering transparent transactions. The VIP section will allow customers to browse brand-curated listings of celebrity-owned products, that can now be safely acquired by fans and collectors alike.
